Here there's some solutions for problems at jutge.org, which I used as a
way to practice and warm-up before my interviews at Google.

I haven't tested them but I've checked that they are marked as solved
correctly in my profile, so unless it's an old snapshot the implementation
should be good to submit.

You might find me as 'davidgf' at jutge.org
